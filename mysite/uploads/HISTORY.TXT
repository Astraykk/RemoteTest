Changes in SecureCRT 5.5 (Official) -- April 5, 2007
----------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - SSH2: The SSH_IGNORE message is only shown in trace output when
    the session's trace level is set to a value greater than one.


Changes in SecureCRT 5.5 (Beta 4) -- March 27, 2007
---------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - VT100 line-drawing characters were not displayed correctly under
    Windows Vista or when the East Asian language pack was installed.
  - The word delimiter characters session setting did not work
    correctly for tabbed sessions.
  - If the log file name or custom log data substitution %h (2-digit
    hour) was used between 03/11/07 and 03/31/07 or 10/28/07 and
    11/03/07, the hours could have been off by an hour.
  - SSH2: SecureCRT crashed when attempting to convert a file that was
    not a private key to OpenSSH format.


Changes in SecureCRT 5.5 (Beta 3) -- March 15, 2007
---------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - SSH1/SSH2: Added support for optionally making SecureCRT the
    default URL handler for SSH1 and SSH2.
  - SSH2: Added support for exporting public keys from X.509
    certificates.

Changes:

  - SSH1/SSH2: Added a command-line option (/Z 0) which turns off
    compression.
  - SSH2: In order to be compliant with the IETF draft
    draft-saarenmaa-ssh-x509-00.txt, the SHA1 hash algorithm is used
    by default with X.509 RSA host keys and public keys.
  - SSH2: Additional certificate information is shown in the trace
    output and the certificate error dialog when attempting to use
    an X.509 certificate for authentication.

Bug fixes:

  - The escape sequence to turn off line wrap mode was honored even
    though the option "Enable line wrap mode switching" was off.


Changes in SecureCRT 5.5 (Beta 2) -- February 27, 2007
------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - The default font has been changed to "Lucida Console" due to a
    Windows Vista compatibility issue.  This change only affects new
    installations of SecureCRT.
  - It is now possible to change the passphrase for an OpenSSH style
    private key.
  - When the Disconnect custom string is logged, an end of line is
    appended.

Bug fixes:

  - If the "Open in a tab" option was off in the Connect dialog and
    multiple sessions were selected after choosing the "Connect in
    Tabs" menu item, the sessions were not opened in tabs.
  - If the specified log file was a valid path, but did not have a
    filename and the "Prompt for filename" option was not set, when
    logging started, an error that the specified file could not be
    created was reported.
  - After choosing to integrate SecureCRT and SecureFX, if privileges
    were not sufficient to write to the registry, it was possible to
    repeatedly be prompted to integrate.
  - SSH1:  If an SSH1 session was disconnected while a terminal window
    size change was in progress, SecureCRT could crash.
  - SSH2: Attempting to generate a DSA key that was not a multiple of
    64 resulted in an Unknown Application Error.
  - SFTP: Under certain circumstances, ASCII files being transferred
    in an SFTP tab were corrupted.


Changes in SecureCRT 5.5 (Beta 1) -- February 8, 2007
-----------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Windows Vista support.
  - Added a script recorder, which generates VB scripts.  When
    "Start Recording Script" is selected from the Script menu, all
    keystrokes in the current session are recorded until "Stop
    Recording Script" is selected.
  - A set of sessions can be launched automatically on startup by
    specifying folders or multiple sessions as auto sessions.
  - Added the ability to insert custom data to log files.  Custom
    data can be inserted when a session connects, disconnects, or
    on each line.  Substitution parameters for session, date, and
    time information are supported.  Additionally, there is an
    option to log only custom data.
  - When ANSI color is being used, it is now possible to use a color
    scheme, which allows the background to be something other than
    black and the foreground to be something other than white.
  - Added script function GetScriptTab, which returns the tab from
    which the script was started.
  - Added new custom menu item MENU_TAB_LIST1, which causes all the
    tabbed sessions to be displayed in the menu.
  - SFTP: Added "ascii" and "binary" command options to the SFTP tab.
  - SSH2: Added support for generating OpenSSH format keys and for
    converting VanDyke format private keys to OpenSSH format.
  - SSH2: Added a global option to cache passwords for SSH2
    sessions.
  - SSH2: Added support for zlib@openssh.com compression.  With this
    compression method, compression does not start until after
    authentication, which prevents unencrypted passwords from being
    cached by the zlib library.

Changes:

  - By default, Internet Explorer 7 disables Telnet through a
    registry setting.  Added support for overriding this setting
    so that SecureCRT can be set as the default Telnet application.
    Administrator privileges are required in order to override the
    setting.  Versions of Internet Explorer prior to 7 are not
    affected by this change.
  - When multiple sessions are opened from the "Connect" dialog, if
    the "Open in a tab" setting is off, the sessions are opened in
    tabs in a new window.
  - The chat window can now be toggled when SecureCRT is maximized
    or full screen.
  - When creating a session, if the Terminal, VT100, or VT102 font
    is selected, the "Use Unicode line-drawing characters" will be
    unchecked.
  - The "Save connected folder state" option was moved from the
    "Connect" dialog to the "General" page in the "Global Options"
    dialog.
  - Files with .VBE extension are included in the Script Files
    filter in the "Select Script to Run" dialog.

Bug fixes:

  - Under certain circumstances, text was highlighted incorrectly
    after highlighted text had been pasted into a session.
  - Under certain circumstances, when SecureCRT got an error and
    became unresponsive, the Migration wizard ran.
  - It was not possible to cancel out of the "Global Options" dialog
    if an incorrect status indicator width or minimum tab width was
    entered.
  - When using send string functionality with a mapped key, \p
    (pause) did not work correctly.
  - If the specified log file was a valid path, but did not have a
    filename and the "Prompt for filename" option was not set, when
    logging started, an error that the specified file could not be
    created was reported.
  - If a script that connected to a session was run in a tabbed
    session that had been disconnected, the script hung.
  - The script function ConnectInTab used the default session font
    instead of the specified session's font.
  - The /SCRIPT command-line argument was not honored when /T was
    used and the session was opened in a tab other than the first
    tab.  
  - SSH1: The command-line option /I pubkeyfile command-line option
    did not work with /SSH1.
  - SSH2: Under certain circumstances, using a SOCKS proxy caused
    the Secure Shell transport to hang.
